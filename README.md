Project Description

This is a simple online store project developed as part of an academic assignment. The goal is to create a functional website with a product category of your choice, featuring a limited number of products in the system database. The project is divided into two main components: the website itself and a separate server. The website showcases basic e-commerce functionality, including user authentication, product management, and a simulated checkout process.
Technologies Used

    Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    Backend: Node.js

Project Requirements

The project requirements, as specified by the professor, are as follows:

    Product Category: Choose a product category and populate the system database with no more than 3 or 4 products to demonstrate the website's functionality.

    Server: Create a separate server for the project. Keep in mind that the website and the server are distinct projects, each residing in its own folder.

    User Authentication:
        Unauthenticated users can view the website in its intended form, search for products, and view existing products in the system.
        Authenticated users can add, remove, and checkout products. Note that the checkout process is a simulation, with the primary change being the update of product stock values.
        Only authenticated users with the admin role can add, edit, and delete products in the system, as well as change the stock values of each product.

    Unique Login Page: Implement a unique login page for users to authenticate themselves.

    Unique Register Page: Create a unique register page specifically for normal users.

Usage

To run the project, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Navigate to the frontend folder for the website and the backend folder for the server.
    Install the necessary dependencies using npm install.
    Configure the server and database settings as needed.
    Start the server and website by running npm start.
